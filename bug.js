This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses a state variable within it.  The issue is that the closure created by `useCallback` captures the state variable at the time the `useCallback` is called, not at the time the function is executed.  This means that even if the state variable changes, the function within the `useCallback` will still use the old value.
